# ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions

The goal of the competition was according to its own description: predict if a person has any of 3 medical conditions. Further details of the competition are available in Kaggle: [ICR](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/icr-identify-age-related-conditions).

My best solution was achieved wiht a LightGBM Model with a simple cross-validation.

In the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/soyandresromero/age-related-conditions/blob/51aa50311a0fff92eb46be08a1ee480c9eb606b2/ICR_Final_V2.ipynb) is described in detail all the process followed to achieve the results granting me my first Bronze Medal in Kaggle.
